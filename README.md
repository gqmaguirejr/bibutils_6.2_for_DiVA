# bibutils_6.2_for_DiVA
An adaptation of Chris Putnam's [bibutils_6.2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bibutils/)
for working with DiVA (specifically the KTH
Publication Database instance of DiVA). The main changes are in modsin.c and
bibtexo.c (as I needed to read MODS in and output BibTeX). I have also added
some comments to some of the other files to help (myself and perhaps others)
to understand how to use the functions and to figure out what does what.

Note that there are two major reasons for the changes:
* changes to handle elements of the MODS file that are used in DiVA but not
previously handled by modsin (including a number of additional MARC roles) -
for further documentation see Kungliga biblioteket/National Library of Sweden, "[SwePub MODS metadata format specification](http://www.kb.se/dokument/SwePub/v.-2.6-SwePub_MODS_Final_version_2015_09_10.pdf)",
Version 2.6, Datum/Date: 2015-09-10, Dnr/Reference no: 1.4.1-2015-822; details
of the DiVA records can be found at Stefan Andersson,

* changes to enable both modsin and bibtexo to produce output in the user's
choice of English or Swedish (as the DiVA records frequently have abstracts
and keywords in both lanugages, but BiBTeX only suports one language at a time
for a given reference).

Once you have the MODS file from DiVA you can say:
```
xml2bib file_name.mods > file_name.bib
```
and you get the version of the abstract and keywords in English (can can also explicitly say --english)

or
```
xml2bib --swedish file_name.xml > file_name.bib
```
and you get the Swedish version.

The titles are handled in a rather complex fashion, but it is fully explained
in the bibtexo.c file. I hope that I have the logic correct for this, as I
have only tested on a small set of test cases.

For example, in Swedish the title will be:
```
title="Virtuell verklighet f{\"o}r f{\"o}rmedling av ett f{\"o}retags produkter: En unders{\"o}kning av kunders beslutsprocess i valet av k{\"o}ksmoduler gjord ur ett l{\"a}randeperspektiv [Virtual Reality for communicating a company's products: A survey of customers' decision-making in the process of choosing kitchen modules made from a learning perspective] (med engelsk sammanfattning)",
```
while in English the title will be:
```
title="Virtuell verklighet f{\"o}r f{\"o}rmedling av ett f{\"o}retags produkter: En unders{\"o}kning av kunders beslutsprocess i valet av k{\"o}ksmoduler gjord ur ett l{\"a}randeperspektiv [Virtual Reality for communicating a company's products: A survey of customers' decision-making in the process of choosing kitchen modules made from a learning perspective] (with English summary)",
```

With the first part of the title being in the language of the thesis, the
second the title in the other language, and the parenthetical saying that
there is an English summary of the thesis.
